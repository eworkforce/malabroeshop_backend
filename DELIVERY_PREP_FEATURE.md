**Features:**
- Aggregates all orders with status = `"paid"`
- Groups order items by product
- Shows total quantity per product
- Lists all orders containing each product
- Supports date range filtering
- Calculates total revenue from paid orders
- Sorts products by quantity (highest first)

### 2. **Query Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Format | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `date_from` | string | No | YYYY-MM-DD | Filter orders from this date |
| `date_to` | string | No | YYYY-MM-DD | Filter orders until this date |

### 3. **Response Structure**

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_paid_orders": 11,
    "total_unique_products": 4,
    "total_revenue": 2970.0,
    "last_updated": "2025-10-05T19:52:32.322501"
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "product_id": 2,
      "product_name": "Tomates",
      "total_quantity": 15,
      "unit": "kg",
      "order_count": 6,
      "unique_customers": 2,
      "orders": [
        {
          "order_id": 15,
          "order_reference": "MALABRO-SLISAE",
          "customer_name": "Admin",
          "quantity": 1,
          "created_at": "2025-09-13T09:07:46"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "date_range": {
    "date_from": null,
    "date_to": null
  }
}
```

### Test Scenarios Passed

1. **‚úÖ All Paid Orders** - Retrieved all 11 paid orders successfully
2. **‚úÖ Date Filtering** - Correctly filtered orders by date range
3. **‚úÖ Product Aggregation** - Properly grouped 4 unique products
4. **‚úÖ Quantity Calculation** - Accurate total quantities per product
5. **‚úÖ Order Details** - Included all order references and customer names
6. **‚úÖ Revenue Calculation** - Correct total revenue: 2970 FCFA

### Sample Test Data
```
Total Paid Orders: 11

### 2. Filter by Date Range

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/orders/preparation-summary?date_from=2025-09-09&date_to=2025-09-22" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Get Today's Preparation List

```bash
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/orders/preparation-summary?date_from=$TODAY&date_to=$TODAY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Get This Week's Preparation List

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries
- Filters orders with `status == "paid"`
- Joins with `order_items` to get product details
- Fetches `product` and `unit_of_measure` for display

### Performance
- Loads all paid orders into memory (acceptable for current scale)
- Uses Python dictionaries for fast aggregation
- Sorts results before returning

### Error Handling
- Validates date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Returns empty result if no paid orders found
- Handles missing unit of measure gracefully

## üë• Team Notes

### For Frontend Developers
- Endpoint is ready for integration
- Use the summary card + modal approach recommended
- Date picker should use YYYY-MM-DD format
- Handle empty results gracefully
- Consider caching response for 5-10 minutes

### For DevOps
- No database migrations required
- Existing tables used (orders, order_items, products)
- No new dependencies added
- Performance should be good for up to 1000 orders

### For QA
- Test with various date ranges
- Verify product aggregation is correct
- Check edge cases (no paid orders, single product)
- Validate authorization (admin only)
